Rancher's Webhook follows a pre-release (v0.x) strategy of semver. There no compatibility between releases. Instead, each Webhook version aims to be compatible with a single version of Rancher. The current supported versions of the Webhook (and the compatible version of rancher) are as follows:

| Webhook Branch | Webhook Minor version | Rancher Minor Version |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| main | v0.9 | v2.13 |
| release/v0.8 | v0.8 | v2.12 |
| release/v0.7 | v0.7 | v2.11 |
| release/v0.6 | v0.6 | v2.10 |
| release/v0.5 | v0.5 | v2.9 |
| release/v0.4 | v0.4 | v2.8 |
| release/v0.3 | v0.3 | v2.7 |
