## Namespace 

### Validation Checks

Note: The `kube-system` namespace, unlike other namespaces, has a `failPolicy` of `ignore` on update calls.

#### Project annotation
Verifies that the annotation `field.cattle.io/projectId` value can only be updated by users with the `manage-namespaces` 
verb on the project specified in the annotation.

#### PSA Label Validation

Validates that users who create or edit a PSA enforcement label on a namespace have the `updatepsa` verb on `projects` 
in `management.cattle.io/v3`. See the [upstream docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) 
for more information on the effect of these labels.

The following labels are considered relevant for PSA enforcement: 
- pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce
- pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version 
- pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit 
- pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version 
- pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn
- pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version

## Secret 

### Validation Checks

A secret cannot be deleted if its deletion request has an orphan policy,
and the secret has roles or role bindings dependent on it.

### Mutation Checks

#### On create

For all secrets of type `provisioning.cattle.io/cloud-credential`, 
places a `field.cattle.io/creatorId` annotation with the name of the user as the value.

#### On delete

Checks if there are any RoleBindings owned by this secret which provide access to a role granting access to this secret.
If yes, the webhook redacts the role, so that it only grants a deletion permission.

## ClusterRoleTemplateBinding 

### Validation Checks

#### Escalation Prevention

Users can only create/update ClusterRoleTemplateBindings which grant permissions to RoleTemplates with rights less than or equal to those they currently possess. This is to prevent privilege escalation. 

#### Invalid Fields - Create

Users cannot create ClusterRoleTemplateBindings which violate the following constraints:
- Either a user subject (through `UserName` or `UserPrincipalName`) or a group subject (through `GroupName` or `GroupPrincipalName`) must be specified; both a user subject and a group subject cannot be specified
- `ClusterName` must be specified
- The roleTemplate indicated in `RoleTemplateName` must be:
  - Provided as a non-empty value
  - Valid (i.e. is an existing `roleTemplate` object of given name in the `management.cattle.io/v3` API group)
  - Not locked (i.e. `roleTemplate.Locked` must be `false`)
  - Associated with its appropriate context (`roleTemplate.Context` must be equal to "cluster")

#### Invalid Fields - Update

Users cannot update the following fields after creation:
- RoleTemplateName
- ClusterName

Users can update the following fields if they have not been set, but after they have been set they cannot be changed:
- UserName
- UserPrincipalName
- GroupName
- GroupPrincipalName

In addition, as in the create validation, both a user subject and a group subject cannot be specified.

## Feature 

### Validation Checks

#### On update

The desired value must not change on new spec unless it's equal to the `lockedValue` or `lockedValue` is nil.

## GlobalRole 

### Validation Checks

Note: all checks are bypassed if the GlobalRole is being deleted.

#### Invalid Fields - Create and Update
When a GlobalRole is created or updated, the webhook checks that each rule has at least one verb.

#### Escalation Prevention

Users can only change GlobalRoles with rights less than or equal to those they currently possess. This is to prevent privilege escalation. 

## GlobalRoleBinding 

### Validation Checks

Note: all checks are bypassed if the GlobalRoleBinding is being deleted.

#### Escalation Prevention

Users can only create/update GlobalRoleBindings with rights less than or equal to those they currently possess. This is to prevent privilege escalation. 

#### Valid Global Role Reference

GlobalRoleBindings must refer to a valid global role (i.e. an existing `GlobalRole` object in the `management.cattle.io/v3` apiGroup).

## NodeDriver 

### Validation Checks

Note: checks only run if a node driver is being disabled or deleted

#### Machine Deletion Prevention

This admission webhook prevents the disabling or deletion of a NodeDriver if there are any Nodes that are under management by said driver. If there are _any_ nodes that use the driver the request will be denied.

## ProjectRoleTemplateBinding 

### Validation Checks

#### Escalation Prevention

Users can only create/update ProjectRoleTemplateBindings with rights less than or equal to those they currently possess.
This is to prevent privilege escalation.

#### Invalid Fields - Create

Users cannot create ProjectRoleTemplateBindings that violate the following constraints:

- Either a user subject (through `UserName` or `UserPrincipalName`), or a group subject (through `GroupName`
  or `GroupPrincipalName`), or a service account subject (through `ServiceAccount`) must be specified. Exactly one
  subject type of the three must be provided.
- `ProjectName` must be specified
- The roleTemplate indicated in `RoleTemplateName` must be:
    - Provided as a non-empty value
    - Valid (there must exist a `roleTemplate` object of given name in the `management.cattle.io/v3` API group)
    - Not locked (`roleTemplate.Locked` must be `false`)
    - Associated with its appropriate context (`roleTemplate.Context` must be equal to "project")

#### Invalid Fields - Update

Users cannot update the following fields after creation:

- RoleTemplateName
- ProjectName
- ServiceAccount

Users can update the following fields if they had not been set. But after getting initial values, the fields cannot be
changed:

- UserName
- UserPrincipalName
- GroupName
- GroupPrincipalName

In addition, as in the create validation, both a user subject and a group subject cannot be specified.

## RoleTemplate 

### Validation Checks

Note: all checks are bypassed if the RoleTemplate is being deleted

####  Circular Reference

Circular references to a `RoleTemplate` (a inherits b, b inherits a) are not allowed. More specifically, if "roleTemplate1" is included in the `roleTemplateNames` of "roleTemplate2", then "roleTemplate2" must not be included in the `roleTemplateNames` of "roleTemplate1". This check prevents the creation of roles whose end-state cannot be resolved.

#### Rules Without Verbs 

Rules without verbs are not permitted. The `rules` included in a RoleTemplate are of the same type as the rules used by standard Kubernetes RBAC types (such as `Roles` from `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`). Because of this, they inherit the same restrictions as these types, including this one.

#### Escalation Prevention

Users can only change RoleTemplates with rights less than or equal to those they currently possess. This prevents privilege escalation. 

#### Context Validation

The `roletemplates.context` field must be one of the following values [`"cluster"`, `"project"`, `""`].
If the `roletemplates.administrative` is set to true the context must equal `"cluster"`.

#### Builtin Validation

The `roletemplates.builtin` field is immutable, and new builtIn RoleTemplates cannot be created.

If `roletemplates.builtin` is true then all fields are immutable except:
- `metadata` 
- `clusterCreatorDefault` 
- `projectCreatorDefault`
- `locked`

 ### Deletion check

RoleTemplate can not be deleted if they are referenced by other RoleTemplates via `roletemplates.roleTemplateNames`

## Setting 

### Validation Checks

#### Invalid Fields - Create

When a Setting is created, the following checks take place:

- If set, `disable-inactive-user-after` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
- If set, `delete-inactive-user-after` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
- If set, `user-last-login-default` must be a date time according to RFC3339 (e.g. `2023-11-29T00:00:00Z`).
- If set, `user-retention-cron` must be a valid standard cron expression (e.g. `0 0 * * 0`).

#### Invalid Fields - Update

When a Setting is updated, the following checks take place:

- If set, `disable-inactive-user-after` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
- If set, `delete-inactive-user-after` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
- If set, `user-last-login-default` must be a date time according to RFC3339 (e.g. `2023-11-29T00:00:00Z`).
- If set, `user-retention-cron` must be a valid standard cron expression (e.g. `0 0 * * 1`).

## UserAttribute 

### Validation Checks

#### Invalid Fields - Create

When a UserAttribute is created, the following checks take place:

- If set, `lastLogin` must be a valid date time according to RFC3339 (e.g. `2023-11-29T00:00:00Z`).
- If set, `disableAfter` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
- If set, `deleteAfter` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).

#### Invalid Fields - Update

When a UserAttribute is updated, the following checks take place:

- If set, `lastLogin` must be a valid date time according to RFC3339 (e.g. `2023-11-29T00:00:00Z`).
- If set, `disableAfter` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
- If set, `deleteAfter` must be zero or a positive duration (e.g. `240h`).
