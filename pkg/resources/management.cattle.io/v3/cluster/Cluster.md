#### Feature: version management on imported RKE2/K3s cluster 

- When a cluster is created or updated, add the `rancher.io/imported-cluster-version-management: system-default` annotation if the annotation is missing or its value is an empty string.


## Validation Checks

### Annotations validation

When a cluster is created and `field.cattle.io/creator-principal-name` annotation is set then `field.cattle.io/creatorId` annotation must be set as well. The value of `field.cattle.io/creator-principal-name` should match the creator's user principal id.

When a cluster is updated `field.cattle.io/creator-principal-name` and `field.cattle.io/creatorId` annotations must stay the same or removed.

If `field.cattle.io/no-creator-rbac` annotation is set, `field.cattle.io/creatorId` cannot be set.


#### Feature: version management on imported RKE2/K3s cluster

 - When a cluster is created or updated, the `rancher.io/imported-cluster-version-management` annotation must be set with a valid value (true, false, or system-default). 
 - If the cluster represents other types of clusters and the annotation is present, the webhook will permit the request with a warning that the annotation is intended for imported RKE2/k3s clusters and will not take effect on this cluster.
 - If version management is determined to be disabled, and the `.spec.rke2Config` or `.spec.k3sConfig` field exists in the new cluster object with a value different from the old one, the webhook will permit the update with a warning indicating that these changes will not take effect until version management is enabled for the cluster.
 - If version management is determined to be disabled, and the `.spec.rke2Config` or `.spec.k3sConfig` field is missing, the webhook will permit the request to allow users to remove the unused fields via API or Terraform.


#### Feature: Cluster Agent Scheduling Customization

The `SchedulingCustomization` subfield of the `DeploymentCustomization` field defines the properties of a Pod Disruption Budget and Priority Class which will be automatically deployed by Rancher for the cattle-cluster-agent.

The `schedulingCustomization.PriorityClass` field contains two attributes

+ `value`: This must be an integer value equal to or between negative 1 billion and 1 billion.
+ `preemption`: This must be a string value which indicates the desired preemption behavior, its value can be either `PreemptLowerPriority` or `Never`. Any other value must be rejected.

The `schedulingCustomization.PodDisruptionBudget` field contains two attributes

+ `minAvailable`: This is a string value that indicates the minimum number of agent replicas that must be running at a given time.
+ `maxUnavailable`: This is a string value that indicates the maximum number of agent replicas that can be unavailable at a given time.

Both `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` must be a string which represents a non-negative whole number, or a whole number percentage greater than or equal to `0%` and less than or equal to `100%`. Only one of the two fields can have a non-zero or empty value at a given time. These fields use the following regex when assessing if a given percentage value is valid:
```regex
^([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|100)%$
```
