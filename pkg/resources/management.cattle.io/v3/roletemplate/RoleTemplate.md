## Validation Checks

Note: all checks are bypassed if the RoleTemplate is being deleted

###  Circular Reference

Circular references to a `RoleTemplate` (a inherits b, b inherits a) are not allowed. More specifically, if "roleTemplate1" is included in the `roleTemplateNames` of "roleTemplate2", then "roleTemplate2" must not be included in the `roleTemplateNames` of "roleTemplate1". This check prevents the creation of roles whose end-state cannot be resolved.

### Rules Without Verbs, Resources, API groups

Rules without verbs, resources, or apigroups are not permitted. The `rules` and `externalRules` included in a RoleTemplate are of the same type as the rules used by standard Kubernetes RBAC types (such as `Roles` from `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`). Because of this, they inherit the same restrictions as these types, including this one.

### Escalation Prevention

Users can only change RoleTemplates with rights less than or equal to those they currently possess. This prevents privilege escalation. 
Users can't create external RoleTemplates (or update existing RoleTemplates) with `ExternalRules` without having the `escalate` verb on that RoleTemplate.

### Context Validation

The `roletemplates.context` field must be one of the following values [`"cluster"`, `"project"`, `""`].
If the `roletemplates.administrative` is set to true the context must equal `"cluster"`.

### Builtin Validation

The `roletemplates.builtin` field is immutable, and new builtIn RoleTemplates cannot be created.

If `roletemplates.builtin` is true then all fields are immutable except:
- `metadata` 
- `clusterCreatorDefault` 
- `projectCreatorDefault`
- `locked`

 ### Deletion check

RoleTemplate can not be deleted if they are referenced by other RoleTemplates via `roletemplates.roleTemplateNames` or by GlobalRoles via `globalRoles.inheritedClusterRoles`
